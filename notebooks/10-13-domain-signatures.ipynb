       "\"2017's 3 Best Index Funds  \\n2017 has been a tumultuous year, with plenty going on in the political and financial realms. Yet the stock market has done quite well, and index funds that track popular stock benchmarks have given their investors solid returns. In particular, among the most popular exchange-traded funds, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (NYSEMKT: EEM), PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ), and iShares Core MSCI EAFE (NYSEMKT: IEFA) have delivered some of the best returns. \\nContinue Reading Below \\nData source: Fund providers, ETFdb.com. \\nAmong U.S.-oriented index funds, the PowerShares QQQ leads the field with strong returns in the upper teens. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index Opens a New Window., which is composed of the 100 top nonfinancial companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. Although intermingling of stocks across the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges over the past several years has made both indexes more diverse, the Nasdaq still has a preponderance of technology companies within its upper echelon. That makes the index particularly susceptible to tech-stock trends, and when technology is in the ascendancy -- as it has been so far in 2017 -- the Nasdaq does well. \\nThe PowerShares QQQ does a good job of tracking the Nasdaq, with a relatively low 0.2% expense ratio taking only a minimal portion of the overall return of the index. With ample liquidity from plenty of trading volume every day, the PowerShares QQQ is an efficient way for you to tap into the profit potential of the Nasdaq and amplify your domestic stock exposure. \\nAdvertisement \\nImage source: Getty Images. \\nWhat's noteworthy, though, is that international markets have, in general, outpaced returns in the U.S. That's true both in other developed markets, where the MSCI EAFE index governs, and in emerging markets. \\nThe two iShares funds represented here not only blanket the world between them, but also have different approaches toward their investing strategies and business models. The iShares Emerging Markets ETF tracks emerging-market stocks, and it's designed for use by institutional investors, with high trading volumes and ample liquidity. However, as you can see from the 0.69% expense ratio, the index fund is relatively costly compared to other ETFs. \\nIt's true that investing in emerging markets involves more expense than buying and selling stocks in the U.S. and in other better-developed markets, but even so, the iShares offering isn't the most cost-effective solution. That's why it's noteworthy that the ETF has outpaced some of its lower-cost peers. \\nMeanwhile, the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF is an example of a lower-cost philosophy from iShares. The core series of ETFs Opens a New Window. are designed for longer-term investors, with less liquidity, but lower expenses. Investors have the opportunity to pay just 0.08% in annual expenses using the Core MSCI EAFE fund, and that compares quite favorably to the 0.33% expense ratio that its non-core iShares counterpart charges. \\nOverseas markets have done well so far in 2017. Improving economic conditions suggest that a long period of sluggishness might finally be coming to an end, and many investors have seen international stocks as being better bargains than the U.S. stock market, especially after eight years of bull-market conditions. That has pushed up international index funds across the board, but iShares stands out with superior performance compared to other large providers so far this year. \\n2017 has been kind to these three ETFs, and the trends that have supported their returns will likely continue further into the year. By understanding why these funds have done so well, you can get some insight into choosing ETFs that are likely to be the best in the future. \\n10 stocks we like better than PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

       "'Wall Street Worries How Patient Fed will Remain The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 fell on Tuesday as materials shares declined and nervousness increased ahead of a Federal Reserve statement, while the Nasdaq ended higher. \\nStocks cut losses in afternoon trading, led by a rise in tech shares. The S&amp;P 500 technology index ended up 0.1 percent, helped by gains in Apple, up 1.7 percent at $127.04, and Facebook, up 1.7 percent at $79.36. \\nContinue Reading Below \\nAfter the bell, shares of Oracle rose 3.4 percent to $44.33 following results. \\nInvestors were anxious as the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off a two-day policy meeting, to be followed by a statement from Fed Chair Janet Yellen Wednesday afternoon. \\nMost economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be \"patient\" about raising interest rates from its statement. Market strategists said with or without a change in the language, the Fed may still be on track to raise rates as early as June. \\n\"People are waiting for the Fed to provide some degree of clarity,\" said Michael O\\'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. \\nAmong S&amp;P 500 sectors, materials was the weakest with a 1.2 percent decline, led by DuPont, down 3.1 percent at $74.68. \\nAdvertisement \\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.34 points, or 0.71 percent, to 17,849.08, the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.91 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,074.28 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.93 points, or 0.16 percent, to 4,937.44. \\nIn addition to anxiety about the Fed statement, options expiration on Friday may have contributed to the day\\'s volatility, said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist, Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston. \\nWhile higher rates would be a sign of strength in the U.S. economy, some investors question whether the economy is strong enough to handle increased borrowing costs. \\nThe S&amp;P 500\\'s pullback followed its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3 on Monday. \\nJohnson &amp; Johnson weighed most heavily on the S&amp;P 500 with a 1.2 percent decline to $99.89. \\nAlso boosting the Nasdaq, shares in American Airlines jumped 6.9 percent to $53.69 after an announcement that it would join the S&amp;P 500. \\nAbout 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to BATS Global Markets. \\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,607 to 1,429, for a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,384 issues rose and 1,330 fell, for a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. \\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 62 new lows. \\n(By Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Nick Zieminski and James Dalgleish)'"
